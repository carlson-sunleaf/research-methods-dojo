Datastore classes: let students and instructors have multiple rows (one per course)

Instructor:
	First name
	Last name
	Email
	Password
	CourseNumber
	CourseName

Student:
	First name
	Last name
	Email
	Password
	ID Number
	
	Course1
		Tutorial1
		Tutorial2
	Course2
		Tutorial5
		Tutorial7
	Course3
		Tutorial3
		Tutorial4



When an instructor sees the view, they will see part of the Student dataframe, subsetted to their class
