Cory:
-Think about dealing with passwords: encrypting them? We don't want passwords they use for anything else!
	App Engine datastore is encrypted and we use https, so I think we should be 	okay.
	
	Can we use another site's login system? Pitt? Google? (don't worry about this 	for now, but we need to think of something eventually)




Kevin:



Leftover to-dos from 2016:
-Main menu: eventually make this a table? If we have more than two (or if we want them to take them in order), numbering them would be a good idea. 

-Dataframe fix: look in "user", updates the user info without creating a new row
